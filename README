# `mkws(1)`

## Requirements

A UNIX like operating system is recommended like
[macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/),
[Linux](https://kernel.org) or
[BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BSD_operating_systems)
variant (our favorites are [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org) and
[Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/)).
Also, familiarity with the command line is good to have.
`mkws(1)` can also run on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows)
via the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Installation (applies to [Linux](https://kernel.org))

You'll have to download [https://mkws.sh/mkws@4.0.1.tgz](
https://mkws.sh/mkws@4.0.1.tgz). Once you have the archive, unpack
it and rename the newly created directory:

	mkdir -p ~/src/
	cd ~/src/
	tar -xzfv ~/Downloads/mkws@4.0.1.tgz
	mv ws.sh example.com

## Make web site

Create an `index.upphtml` file, it will be preprocessed with
[`pp(1)`](https://mkws.sh/pp.html), and run `./bin/mkws` with the url
of your web site:

	cd example.com
	cat <<EOF > index.upphtml
	<p>
	#!
	echo hello, world
	#!
	</p>
	EOF
	./bin/mkws https://example.com

You can create more `*.upphtml` files to make additional pages, the
layout file is held in `./share/l.upphtml`.

Also, you can always modify your `./bin/mkws` script, if it's the case.

## Important!

Because [`pp(1)`](https://mkws.sh/pp.html) uses
[`sh(1)`](
https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html)
internally, double quotes (`"`) must be escaped in templates, so to get
an actual double quote (`"`) you have to write `\"`. This isn't a
problem for `HTML` because [double quoting(`"`) attribute values is
optional and double quotes (`"`) and single quotes(`'`) are
interchangeable](
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#attributes-2).
We recommend not quoting attribute values and using single quotes (`'`)
in special cases.
